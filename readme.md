## The Sandwich Order Management System

The Deli Order Management System is a simple program that helps users create and customize their deli orders step by step. You can build a sandwich by choosing the type of bread, size, toppings, and whether itâ€™s toasted. You can also add drinks and chips to your order. Once your order is complete, you can confirm it and save a receipt with all the details.

## Features
- Error Handling
- Ease of use
- Fairly Organized

## How it Works
1. The program initializes the home menu and allows the user to create a new order or exit
2. When a new order is started:
    - The user's name is captured
    - The user can add sandwiches, drinks, and chips to the order
3. Sandwich customization allows adding, viewing, or removing toppings
4. While Checking out:
    - The order details are displayed
    - The user can confirm or cancel the order
5. Confirming the order generates a receipt in the receipts folder

## Interesting Code - **DefaultTopping**
- The **DefaultTopping** Class was Created to better handle **Toppings** that didn't affect the Price of the **Sandwich**

```java 
public class DefaultTopping extends Topping{

public DefaultTopping(String name) {
  super(name, 0);
  }

  @Override
  public String getType() {
  return "Default";
    } 
  }
```
- This allows me to better Categorize, Organize, and Assign Toppings
```java
sandwich.addTopping(new Cheese(cheeseName, sandwich.getRegularCheesePrice()), false);

sandwich.addTopping(new DefaultTopping("Lettuce"), false);


```
